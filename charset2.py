  charset2.py: A script that takes as stdin-input an rfc822 compliant message
  that gives as stdout-output the same message, but with the charset replaced
  by the target charset. Which charset is used depends on the ending of the
  (symlink) name with which this script is called: 'ansinew', 'utf8', 'â€¦'.
